The purpose of this project is to analyze the current infrastructure in Shelby County, TN if the number of opioids prescribed between 2006-2012 was maintained.

# Background: 

More than 200,000 Americans have died from prescription opioid-related overdoses since the epidemic began in the 1990s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

# The Data:

The DEA's Administration's Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) database aggregated and published by the Washington Post tracking opioid distribution shows there were over 2.5 billion prescription pain pills distributed in Tennessee from 2006 to 2012 (national total: 76 billion). The Post gained access to the data following a court order, publishing the data sets by state and county for media distribution. The data reflects how much hydrocodone and oxycodone went to each state and county along with which companies and distributors were responsible for getting these opioids to the public.
